# Custom Swift XcodeTemplates

## Description

The project is a script that simplifies the process of creating new project structures and specific files in Xcode for iOS developers. By running this script, you can quickly install custom templates that will be ready to use in Xcode whenever you need to create a new file.

Lets say that you have to create a view model for an app flow, you only have to use your viewModel template to have all the basic structure of that kind of file or even if you want to have an entire folder with all the layers that you are using for your architecture you can prepare it in a custom template and install it with this script.

## Features

- Easily create project structures and files in Xcode.
- Saves time by automating the setup process.
- Provides a consistent file organization across projects.
